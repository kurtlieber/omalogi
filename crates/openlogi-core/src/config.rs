/// v7 aligns the thumb-wheel scroll defaults with its normalised physical
/// direction. Pre-v7 explicit default pairs are migrated in device and
/// per-application profiles so they remain native rather than becoming a
/// reversal (see `Config::migrate_thumbwheel_native_direction`).
///
/// v6 adds threshold-based `{ short = ..., long = ... }` button bindings.
///
/// v5 also drops the transport prefix from `direct:` keys: `direct:046d:c08d:unit:6be9d300`
/// names the mouse *and the cable it was plugged into*, so a device moved to a
/// different route was silently orphaned from its settings.
/// [`Config::migrate_transport_scoped_keys`] rewrites such a key to its bare
/// identity fragment (`unit:6be9d300`) — including `selected_device` and every
/// `host_switch_targets` entry — and keeps the dropped route as a
/// [`DeviceConfig::links`] entry. `receiver:` keys are left alone: nothing on
/// disk says which device occupies a pairing slot, so those are folded at
/// runtime instead, on the next online sighting (see `adopt_route`).
///
/// v5 adds the app-wide `ui_scale` preference. Older files default to the
/// standard 100% scale.
///
/// Per-device custom names and the Home gallery view preference are optional
/// and did not require a version bump: absent fields use the model name and
/// responsive grid respectively.
///
/// v4 removes the one-gesture-button-per-device owner lock: gesture mode is a
/// per-button fact read from the binding shape, so `gesture_owner` no longer
/// serializes. Loading a v3-or-older file resolves the old owner and rewrites
/// the shapes to dispatch identically
/// (see `Config::migrate_owner_locked_gestures`); the version gate is what
/// keeps that pass off v4 files, where several gesture-shaped buttons are a
/// deliberate state, not a dormant leftover.
///
/// v3 changes the device map from model keys to physical-device keys. No v2
/// device entries are migrated because model-scoped settings cannot be assigned
/// safely when two identical devices exist.
///
/// v2 merged the per-device `button_bindings` + `gesture_bindings` maps into a
/// single `bindings: BTreeMap<ButtonId, Binding>`. A v1 file still loads (the
/// `RawDeviceConfig` shim folds the legacy fields) and self-heals to v2 on the
