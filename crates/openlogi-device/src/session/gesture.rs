//! Live control capture for one device: divert the device's gesture sources
//! (DPI/ModeShift, the MX dedicated gesture button and/or the MX Master 4
//! haptic panel), and the thumb wheel over HID++ and turn their events
//! into [`CapturedInput`] the GUI can dispatch.
//!
//! [`run_capture_session`] runs on the HID++ channel inventory already holds
//! open for one device, enables diversion on whichever of those controls it
//! exposes, registers one message listener, and restores every control's
//! default mapping on shutdown. Using that one channel matters: a second
//! channel to the same device would split its input-report stream, so all
//! captured controls share this session. The channel lifecycle itself is
//! `session::capture`'s, shared with the keyboard session; this module owns
//! what is armed (`arm`) and what its reports mean (`accum`).
//!
//! The session is transport-only — it has no opinion on what an input *does*.
//! The GUI maps each [`CapturedInput`] to the user's bound action and dispatches
//! it, mirroring how the CGEventTap hook handles the side buttons. The thumb
//! wheel is special: diverting it stops native horizontal scroll, so the GUI
//! re-synthesises scroll from the [`CapturedInput::Scroll`] deltas — the wheel
//! is therefore only diverted when the user's thumbwheel config leaves its
//! defaults (click bound, rotation rebound, or sensitivity changed).
