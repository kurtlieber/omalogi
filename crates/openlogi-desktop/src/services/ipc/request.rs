//! What the GUI asks of the agent: one type per request.
//!
//! A request knows two things about itself — how to make its RPC over a live
//! client, and how to deliver the outcome to whoever asked, including the
//! outcome "no agent could be reached". Both live in one `impl`, so the
//! unreachable answer cannot drift from the reachable one, and adding a
//! request is one type plus one line in [`Command`], not an edit to parallel
//! dispatch tables.
//!
//! Replies take the shape the asker can consume. Reads carry a `oneshot` back
//! to the task awaiting them. Standalone-light writes and pairing commands
//! report through the GUI update stream, because the state that acts on them
//! is synchronous and the runtime is the one place that turns an IPC reply
//! into a state event. Fire-and-forget writes only log a rejection: the next
//! snapshot shows what the device actually did.
